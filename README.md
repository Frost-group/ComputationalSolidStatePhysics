# Computational solid state physics

Welcome to the Computational Solid State Physics book / lecture notes; a work in progress. These are being developed to support the solid-state taught component on the Solution processable Electronic Materials (SEM) MRes at Imperial College.

There are a set of workshops on running calculations in ASE/GPAW:
