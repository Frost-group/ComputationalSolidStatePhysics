Introduction
============

In this final part of the course, we will use computational tools to understand
solid-state physics. Solid-state physics is complex and messy (Murray Gell-Mann
described it as the ‘squalid-state’). In an undergraduate curriculum we are
limited to what we can understand analytically, and calculations that are
tractable by hand. Therefore we are limited to non-interacting quantum
theories, and one-dimensional ‘toy’ examples of perfect ‘crystals’. Real
materials are firmly embedded in a three dimensional world. Much important
technical behaviour (even of crystals) is dictated by very low concentrations
of disorder or dopants in the material. In molecular materials, the
microstructure (how the material packs) is of high importance for electrical
and optical properties, but extremely difficult to probe experimentally.
